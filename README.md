Needs to be done for it to "work" in order of importance
create context correctly with movies state
add it to the results page so i can see the selected movie on results
test everything & clean inital bugs, setup proper error
build out the results page, Name,  year it was made, name where to watch
clean up with react native elements 
 
if its on amazon, google, netflix, have something clickable to go to thier page, which we could make revenue 
thats about it
